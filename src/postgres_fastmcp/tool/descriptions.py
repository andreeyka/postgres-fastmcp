# Index Analysis Tools

    "Output: List of recommended indexes with estimated benefits, sizes, and SQL statements to create them. "
    "\n\nIMPORTANT: Provide actual SQL queries that you want to optimize. "
    "The 'dta' method uses cost-based analysis with hypothetical indexes (requires hypopg extension). "
